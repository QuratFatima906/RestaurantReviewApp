# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Project:

## Project Overview

Restaurant Reviews projects, incrementally converts a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## System Requirements
